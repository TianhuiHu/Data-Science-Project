    "On the other end of the spectrum, we were also curious about trying out really fancy models, so we created and ran a neural network on the data. While K-Nearest-Neighbors was the weakest model we could think to run, a neural network was the strongest thing we could think to do. We expected its performance to be quite high, but discovered exactly the opposite. When initially training the network, we were excited to see it classifying 93% of examples correctly until we realized that it was guessing the same value every time. Essentially, the neural network was not learning a real decision boundary but was instead capitalizing on the imbalance on our data to achieve a high accuracy score. In order to combat this, we attempted to weight our classes differently, but unfortunately were unsuccessful. If we had wanted to, we could have pursued undersampling in order to balance the sample. However, we decided it would be best to not throw away large portions of our data. Because of this in combination with the fact that we do not fully understand the inner workings of a neural network, we decided to use a model whose theory we did understand and that enabled us to take advantage of all of the data."
